                        <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
                        <h4>Business Transactions</h4>
                        <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
                            transferred. We will
                            provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different

                        <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
                        <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if
                            required to do so by law
                            or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government
                            agency).</p>
                        <h4>Other legal requirements</h4>
                        <p>The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is
                            necessary to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>

                            <li>Protect against legal liability</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
                        <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of
                            transmission over the Internet,
                            or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially
                            acceptable means to protect Your
                            Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                            Our servers.</p>
                        <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your
                            country requires consent from
                            a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.
